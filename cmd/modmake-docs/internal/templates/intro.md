Modmake is a build system inspired by [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/), but specifically tailored to Go modules.
It also makes an attempt at providing a lot of the fundamental automation needs of Go projects in development.

> **This software is still early in development and pre-v1**, but it's already in use for orchestrating non-trivial Go builds.
Any feedback on the design or functionality of Modmake may be reported in a [new issue](https://github.com/saylorsolutions/modmake/issues/new/choose) on GitHub.
