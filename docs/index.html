        <p>
            Modmake is a build system inspired by <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">GNU Make</a> and <a href="https://gradle.org/">Gradle</a>,
            but specifically tailored to Go modules.
            It also makes an attempt at providing a lot of the fundamental automation needs of Go projects in development.
        </p>
        <aside>
            <b>This software is still early in development and pre-v1</b>, but it's already in use for orchestrating non-trivial Go builds.
            Any feedback on the design or functionality of Modmake may be reported in a <a href="https://github.com/saylorsolutions/modmake/issues/new/choose" target="_blank">new issue</a> on GitHub.
            <br/>
            Thanks in advance! üòÅ

        <h3>Project Commitments</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The last 3 major Go versions will be supported. At the time of this writing 1.21 is the latest, so this module specifies 1.19.
            </li>
            <li>
                The primarily supported method for invoking Modmake builds is <code>go run</code>. The <a href="#modmake-cli">Modmake CLI</a> just makes that a little easier.
            </li>
            <li>
                A user should need nothing more than the Go toolchain (of a supported version) to use Modmake. This supports an idealized slow ramp to onboarding with this system.
                However, additional tooling may be required as more automation requirements are introduced, so the <code>tools</code> step should be used to <code>go install</code> additional dependencies.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>
        <p>
            To get started using Modmake in your own project, you'll first need to <code>go get</code> it.
        </p>
        <code class="block">go get github.com/saylorsolutions/modmake@latest</code>
        <p>
            Next, create <code>modmake/build.go</code> (relative to the root of your project)
            and enter this code into it.
        </p>
        <pre>
package main

import (
    . "github.com/saylorsolutions/modmake"
)

func main() {
    b := NewBuild()
    // This is where you can customize your new Build.
    b.Execute()
}
        </pre>
        <p>
            You can run the default <code>build</code> step with <code>go run ./modmake build</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            The rest of the docs will discuss the <i>concepts</i> of a build model in Modmake.
        </p>
        <aside>
            For the impatient, take a look at the <a href="https://github.com/saylorsolutions/modmake/blob/main/example/helloworld/README.md">examples</a> to get more hands-on with Modmake.
        </aside>
        <h2 id="build-model">Build Model</h2>
        <p>
            A <code>Build</code> model includes a set of standard steps that do nothing by default.
            This is to establish a standard structure for a Build for consistency's sake.
            More build steps may be <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/saylorsolutions/modmake#Build.AddStep">added as needed</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            A Build is intended to act much like any other Go-based CLI tool. The difference is that it's 100% intended to be run with <code>go run</code>.
            Of course &mdash; just like any other Go executable &mdash; a Modmake build may be built into a single static executable, but this is not required.
        </p>
        <p>
            Several flags to control execution are provided, and a user may introspect a build model without looking at the code.
            See the <a href="https://github.com/saylorsolutions/modmake/blob/main/example/helloworld/README.md">hello world example</a> for more details on <code>steps</code> and <code>graph</code> output.
        </p>
        <aside>
            Skipped steps will not run their operation or before/after run hooks, but will still invoke dependencies.
            To prevent executing dependencies and only run the specified Step(s), use the <code>--only</code> flag when calling the build.
        </aside>
        <aside>
            One or more Steps may be skipped with the <code>--skip</code> flag, but any step specified when the Build is invoked will be run regardless.
        </aside>
        <h3 id="build-model_steps">Steps</h3>
        <p>
            A <code>Step</code> is something that may be invoked with either <code>go run</code> or the <a href="#modmake-cli">modmake CLI</a>, but may also
            have <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/saylorsolutions/modmake#Step.DependsOn">dependencies</a> and
            <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/saylorsolutions/modmake#Step.BeforeRun">pre/post</a> actions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Step dependencies are arranged as a directed acyclic graph (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">DAG</a>).
            If a cycle is detected during invocation &mdash; or while running the builtin <code>graph</code> step &mdash; then the Build will panic to include details of the error.
        </p>
        <aside>
            <b>Note:</b> a build step will do nothing by default.
            A step's <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/saylorsolutions/modmake#Step.Does">Does</a> method must be used to make a Step perform some operation.
        </aside>
        <aside>
            A step's <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/saylorsolutions/modmake#Step.BeforeRun">BeforeRun</a> hooks will run in order <i>after</i> dependent steps have executed.
            Dependencies are also executed in order.
        </aside>
        <p>
            Here are the default steps added by default to each build.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>tools</code> - This step is for installing external tools that may be needed for the Build to function as expected.</li>
            <li><code>generate</code> - This step is for generating code (potentially with newly installed tools) that will be required for <code>test</code> and later steps. Depends on <code>tools</code></li>
            <li><code>test</code> - This step should run unit tests in the project. Depends on <code>generate</code>.</li>
            <li><code>benchmark</code> - This step is skipped by default (it's not very often that these need to be run), but the step is here when required. Depends on <code>test</code>.</li>
            <li><code>build</code> - This step is for building the code </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="build-model_tasks">Tasks</h3>
        <p>
            At a more atomic level there exists a <code>Task</code>.
            A Task enables more flexible expression, which contrasts with a Step that provides more structure and standardized expression.
            While a Task and a Step have some similarities, they server very different purposes within a Build. Namely, only a Step may be invoked.
        </p>
        <p>
            A Task is able to chain other tasks with <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/saylorsolutions/modmake#Task.Then">Then</a>,
            and handle failure with <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/saylorsolutions/modmake#Task.Catch">Catch</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/saylorsolutions/modmake#Task">several tasks</a> that may be used to express your desired logic.
            A custom Task may be created as a simple function with this signature.
        </p>
        <pre>
Task(func(ctx context.Context) error {
    // Custom task logic here
    return nil
})
        </pre>
        <aside>
            Any Task can chain other operations after it, but this can be cumbersome with many Tasks. Multiple Tasks may be run in a sequence with the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/saylorsolutions/modmake#Script">Script</a> helper function.
            Any failure that occurs in the Script will stop the sequence, and the error will be immediately returned.
        </aside>
        <h3 id="build-model_invocation">Invocation</h3>
        <p>
            Any Build step may be invoked with either <code>go run</code> or the <a href="#modmake-cli">Modmake CLI</a>, whichever is most convenient.
            Here are the basic steps for setting up a Modmake build.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Create a build file relative to the root of your Go module code in either <code>/modmake/build.go</code>, or at the root, generally as <code>/build.go</code>.</li>
            <li>Configure and test the various steps needed by calling them with <code>go run</code>.</li>
            <li>Commit build code to version control so others can use the Build steps.</li>
        </ol>
        <img src="/modmake/img/invocation.png" alt="invocation example"/>
        <h3 id="api-patterns">API Patterns</h3>
        <p>There are a few common patterns that should be consistently represented around the code base.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <code>Runner</code> may be a parameter or a return value, but <code>Task</code> may only be a return value.
                <ul>
                    <li>This is because a Task is just a function implementing Runner, but a Runner may be <i>anything</i> with a <code>Run</code> method.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                When a filesystem path is an expected parameter, it should be represented as a <a href="https://github.com/saylorsolutions/modmake/blob/main/pathstring.go">PathString</a>.
                This allows for more consistent, safe, and convenient manipulation of paths throughout the package, without mistaking them for normal strings or module paths.
            </li>
            <li>
                The API may panic at configuration time, but should always return an error at run time.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        A panic at configuration time is intended to be a clear indicator to the developer that something is configured incorrectly, or some invariant has been violated.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Runners and Tasks should always return an error from their Run method instead of panicking. If a panic happens inside a Run function, then it's very likely a bug.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                If a goroutine is started in a Task, it should exit before the Task returns.
                This makes Task execution more predictable and easier to understand.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="modmake-cli">Modmake CLI</h2>
        <p>
            The CLI is 100% optional.
            It's provided to make working with Modmake builds a little more convenient.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using plain <code>go run</code> is still a primarily supported Modmake invocation method, and likely will be in perpetuity, but the CLI can provide more consistency to both build resolution and invocation.
            It can also be used to set environment variables that may influence build behavior, providing a sort of build parameterization mechanism.
        </p>
        <aside>
            By default, the CLI will change its working directory to the root of your Go module (the directory where <code>go.mod</code> resides) if not already run in that location.
            This behavior <i>can</i> be overridden, but it's not recommended, and this override may be removed in a later version.
        </aside>
        <p>
            Since this is a 100% Go tool, you could use <code>go install</code> to install the CLI, like this.
        </p>
        <code class="block">
            go install github.com/saylorsolutions/modmake/cmd/modmake@latest
        </code>
        <p>
            When the project reaches a v1, I'll start producing GitHub releases that will include binaries with version information.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you'd like to see what that will look like, you can clone the project and run this command.
        </p>
        <code class="block">
            go run ./modmake install
        </code>
        <p>
            This will call the Modmake build's <code>install</code> step to install a binary for your system at <code>~/go/bin/</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, run <code>modmake --version</code> to see the Git commit and branch used to build the CLI.
        </p>
        <h3 id="modmake-cli_resolution">CLI Build Resolution</h3>
        <p>
            By default, the CLI looks for your Modmake build in this order:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a directory called <code>modmake</code> at the root of your module.</li>
            <li>In a Go file called <code>build.go</code> at the root of your module.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            If none of the locations above are found, then you will need to tell the CLI where to locate your build code with.
            See <code>modmake --help</code> for details.
        </p>
        <aside>
            It's recommended to use the <code>modmake</code> directory for non-trivial build logic, so you can structure your build with additional files for maintainability.
        </aside>
        <h3 id="modmake-cli_invocation">CLI Invocation</h3>
        <p>
            The CLI has its own flags that may be used to influence the Modmake build invocation context.
            To see a listing of these flags see the output of <code>modmake --help</code>
        </p>
        <p>
            Because a Modmake build may <i>also</i> accept flags, the user will need to disambiguate between CLI flags and build flags.
            To pass build flags through the CLI, prefix build flags and arguments with <code>--</code> like this.
        </p>
        <code class="block">
            modmake -e SOME_VAR=value -- --skip generate build
        </code>
